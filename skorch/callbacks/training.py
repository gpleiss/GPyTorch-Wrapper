class Checkpoint(Callback):
    """Save the model during training if the given metric improved.

    This callback works by default in conjunction with the validation
    scoring callback since it creates a ``valid_loss_best`` value
    in the history which the callback uses to determine if this
    epoch is save-worthy.

    You can also specify your own metric to monitor or supply a
    callback that dynamically evaluates whether the model should
    be saved in this epoch.

    Example:

    >>> net = MyNet(callbacks=[Checkpoint()])
    >>> net.fit(X, y)

    Example using a custom monitor where only models are saved in
    epochs where the validation *and* the train loss is best:

    >>> monitor = lambda net: all(net.history[-1, (
    ...     'train_loss_best', 'valid_loss_best')])
    >>> net = MyNet(callbacks=[Checkpoint(monitor=monitor)])
    >>> net.fit(X, y)

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : file-like object, str
      File path to the file or file-like object.
      See NeuralNet.save_params for details what this value may be.

      If the value is a string you can also use format specifiers
      to, for example, indicate the current epoch. Accessible format
      values are ``net``, ``last_epoch`` and ``last_batch``.
      Example to include last epoch number in file name:

      >>> cb = Checkpoint(target="target_{last_epoch[epoch]}.pt")

    monitor : str, function, None
      Value of the history to monitor or callback that determines
      whether this epoch should lead to a checkpoint. The callback
      takes the network instance as parameter.

      In case ``monitor`` is set to ``None``, the callback will save
      the network at every epoch.

      **Note:** If you supply a lambda expression as monitor, you cannot
      pickle the wrapper anymore as lambdas cannot be pickled. You can
      mitigate this problem by using importable functions instead.
